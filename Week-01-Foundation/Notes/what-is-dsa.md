# 📚 What is DSA?

## 🔍 Definition
**DSA** stands for **Data Structures and Algorithms**.
- **Data Structures (DS):** Organized formats to store, access, and manage data efficiently.
- **Algorithms (A):** Step-by-step instructions to solve a problem using data structures.

## 📦 Examples of Common Data Structures

| Data Structure | Real-World Analogy           | Use Case                      |
|----------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Array          | Shoe rack                    | Static storage, index access  |
| Stack          | Plates stack (LIFO)          | Undo/Redo, Back navigation    |
| Queue          | Line at movie ticket counter | Task scheduling (FIFO)        |
| HashMap        | Dictionary                   | Key-value lookup              |
| Tree           | Folder system                | Hierarchical data             |
| Graph          | City map                     | Pathfinding, relationships    |

## ⚙️ What is an Algorithm?

An **algorithm** is a procedure or formula for solving a problem, based on a sequence of actions.

🔁 For example:
> Task: Sort an array  
> Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
